## Pi in the Sky

#### An Adaption for pygame of the Coding Trains's challenge 169

The goal of the game is to catch pies falling out of the sky and assemble the number Pi.

A random number of pies, associated with single digits, will fall from the top of the screen. You control a plate at the bottom of the screen, wich can move left and right. The goal is to catch the correct pie/digit to form the number Pi. The neccessary digits are displayed on screen.

On easy mode, the pies will display digits, the fall speed is low and there is no penalty for mistakes.
On medium, the pies will display digits, the fall speed is higher and you can only make three mistakes before the game ends.
On hard, the pies will display slices corresponding to the digit, the fall speed is higher and you can only make three mistakes before the game ends.
